      Earth Globe Compass is a physics simulation of a compass. On the very top
      it shows current position either from location provider (like GPS or
      network) or it uses inputted location. The compass always shows real North

      time, current time &amp; date, time zone &amp; DST. The app can be also
      used as a live wallpaper.
